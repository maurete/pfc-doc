	abstract = {"Increase profitability, elevate work culture, and
                  exceed productivity goals through {DevOps}
                  practices. More than ever, the effective management
                  of technology is critical for business
                  competitiveness. For decades, technology leaders
                  have struggled to balance agility, reliability, and
                  security. The consequences of failure have never
                  been greater--whether it's the healthcare.gov
                  debacle, cardholder data breaches, or missing the
                  boat with Big Data in the cloud. And yet, high
                  performers using {DevOps} principles, such as
                  Google, Amazon, Facebook, Etsy, and Netflix, are
                  routinely and reliably deploying code into
                  production hundreds, or even thousands, of times per
                  day. Following in the footsteps of The Phoenix
                  Project, The {DevOps} Handbook shows leaders how to
                  replicate these incredible outcomes, by showing how
                  to integrate Product Management, Development, {QA},
                  {IT} Operations, and Information Security to elevate
                  your company and win in the marketplace"--},

@book{gruver,
	title = {Starting and scaling {DevOps} in the enterprise},
	isbn = {978-1-4835-8358-7},
	abstract = {{DevOps} is a fundamental shift in how leading
                  edge companies are starting to manage their software
                  and {IT} work. Businesses need to move more quickly
                  than ever before, and large software organizations
                  are applying these {DevOps} principles to develop
                  new software faster than anyone previously thought
                  possible. {DevOps} started in small organizations
                  and in large organizations that had or created
                  architectures that enabled small teams to
                  independently develop, qualify, and deploy code. The
                  impact on productivity is so dramatic that larger
                  organizations with tightly coupled architectures are
                  realizing they either need to embrace {DevOps} or be
                  left behind. The biggest challenge is that they
                  can’t just empower small teams to work independently
                  because their legacy architectures require
                  coordinating the development, qualification, and
                  deployment of code across hundreds of people. They
                  need a {DevOps} approach that not only addresses
                  their unique challenges, but also helps them reach
                  an organization-wide agreement on where to start and
                  how to scale {DevOps}. That is where Starting and
                  Scaling {DevOps} in the Enterprise comes
                  in. Starting and Scaling {DevOps} in the Enterprise
                  is a quick, easy-to-read guide that helps structure
                  those improvements by providing a framework that
                  large organizations can use to understand {DevOps}
                  principles in the context of their current
                  development processes and gain alignment across the
                  organization for successful implementations. The
                  book illustrates how to analyze your current
                  development and delivery processes to ensure you
                  gain positive momentum by implementing the {DevOps}
                  practices that will have the greatest immediate
                  impact on the productivity of your organization,
                  with the goal of achieving continuous improvement
                  over time.},
